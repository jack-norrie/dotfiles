# dotfiles

## description
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a record of my development environment, i.e. programs I use for development alongside their configurations. This will allow me to move between my various computers, while maintaining a relatively consistent workflow. The main piece of software which makes this possible is GNU Stow, which allows me to symlink the dotfiles in this repository to the their corresponding counterparts in my home directory.

## System Settings
### American Keyboard Layout
For the purpose of programming, having the hash symbol # be displaced by the pound sign Â£ is inconvenient. I find the american layout much easier for the purpose of typing commonly encountered symbols when programming.

### CAPS-LOCK to ESCAPE
When using proper typing technique, the CAPS-LOCK key is a redundant key. Which is a shame since by default it takes a position in the keyboard which is very accessible, i.e. close to the home row. For this reason I recomend rebinding it to a more useful and frequently used key. For me, escape is the best candidate for this remapping, since this is a key I frequently use when performing vim motions.

## Software Config
clone this repository into your home directory. Then install GNU stow and use it to create a symlink between the dotfiles in this repository and their counterparts in your homedirectory. This can be achieved by changing into the dotfiles directory and running stow on the directory:
```
cd dotfiles
stow .
```

If this has been sucesful then you will be able to run `ls -lah` on your home directory and there should be symlinks (indicated with ->) in your home directory pointing at the config dotiles in the dotfiles directory. 

Finally, if there are any files you do not want to be symlinked to your home directory you should specify them in a `.stow-local-ignore` file. There are some sensible file types, like `.git` in here by default.

## Software
The following software are roughly listed in the order in which they should be installed. 

### Terminal Emulator
I use wezterm as my terminal eumlator. It uses true colour and by default comes with a nerd-font installed, meaning that it can immediately benefit from terminal cosmetic upgrades. Furthermore it has good compatability across different operating system and is configured with lua, meaning it is easily extendable.

### Shell
This environemnt is setup with a `zsh` shell in mind. You can check if this is your default shell using `echo $SHELL`. If this is not the default shell of your operating system use the following commands:
```
sudo apt install zsh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```
Then restart your system. After which, if you do not already have a `zshrc` dotfile in your homedirectory, you will be prompted to configure one.

### Basic Terminal Utilities
* neofetch - retrieves system information.
* tree - visdualisation of a directory.

### Version Control
I use git for version control.


### Text Editor
The first piece of software we need to get, without which we will not able to edit our configuration files is a text editor. My text editor of choice is 


## Further-Work
At some point I would like to experiment with nix-os (for linux) and nix-darwin (for mac), this would automate the system settings and software versioning portition of this development environment setup.
